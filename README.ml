Ideas for the story:
Long time ago the kingdom fell into ruin after a misterious army of monsters invaded the land.
The people in the land were hiding in the forests and caves to survive the fury of the enemy.
Among all the kingdom army, only the mage guild survived for years in the underground.
Mages were sent to surface to find the source of the invasion and learn something. No one ever returned, and after some time
the last mages decided to spread their knowledge to the surface in some way, hoping that someone will be able to fight back one day.
The land is full of ruins, dangerous monsters and vicious bandits, but also of hidden knowledge and powerful artifacts.

Sim was raised by his aunt Lea, afer his parents died of a unknown disease spread by the monsters. 
Lea was a former royal advisor and she kept a lot of documents about the kingdom history.
One day, while reading those documents, Sim finds out what was the last resort of the mages, and asked his aunt about the scrolls scattered all over the kingdom.
Lea was against the desire for Sim to go after the scrolls, but Sim was determined to go anyway.
