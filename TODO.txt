Microvania
- change the name of the game and the project
OK create 4 types of elements: thunder, fire, ice, wind
OK create a switchlith that permits you to change element among those available
OK create a sliding text effect to show some messages on screen
- find a way to consume a button press after executing a function (to avoid multiple activations at the same frame)
OK the fireball comes out wrong when shooting to the left
OK the hud position is messed up, again --> the problem is the order of updates, cam must be always first.
OK begin to shorten all the variable names. I hit the chars limit!
- Bug: sometimes obj_solids are not removed when unfreeze (or maybe they are constantly re-added by some code?)
OK logging: log does not work before the config.lua call. find a way to load config first of everything
OK think about dropping the keys and doors system, is too heavy
- do another round of token/chars optimization
   - put dstar strings in the first column of the file (no indent)
   - shorten some variable names
   - delete unused code
   - there's so much I don't use in c_obj.draw()
