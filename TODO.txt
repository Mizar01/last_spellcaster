- change the name of the game and the project
OK create 4 types of elements: thunder, fire, ice, wind
OK create a switchlith that permits you to change element among those available
OK create a sliding text effect to show some messages on screen
- find a way to consume a button press after executing a function (to avoid multiple activations at the same frame)
OK the fireball comes out wrong when shooting to the left
OK the hud position is messed up, again --> the problem is the order of updates, cam must be always first.
OK begin to shorten all the variable names. I hit the chars limit!
- Bug: sometimes obj_solids are not removed when unfreeze (or maybe they are constantly re-added by some code?)
OK logging: log does not work before the config.lua call. find a way to load config first of everything
OK think about dropping the keys and doors system, is too heavy
- do another round of token/chars optimization, here usual suggestions:
   - put dstar strings in the first column of the file (no indent)
   - shorten some variable names
   - delete unused code
   - there's so much I don't use in c_obj.draw()

- when clicking on focus light, for a little moment a redline on top appears, investigate a remove it
OK performance issues when many enemies are on screen
  OK collisions with enemies must be done in the enemy update against c_element and player.
  OK split maps in smaller parts
OK doors do not have to interact with the player directly, but only through switches (remove interact inheritance)
OK implement the passage from a map to another when reaching the map border
OK refine the passage from a map to another vertically (now it it works only if the player doesnt move horizontally too much)
  OK the trick must be differnt from the horizontal one, because the player can jump and fall down
OK Update method is sometimes executed after draw for the first time. This happens because the object creation is done in 
  another update of another object, and the update of the new object will be called only on the next frame, while the draw is called
  in the current frame.
  One way to avoid this is to create a method that also specify in the new how the object must be drawn (a common method used in new and update)
OK implement a memory system that remember open doors/switches and burnt vines
OK check or make that wandering enemies will bounce on the map limits (even if there are no solids)
OK scroll should show what the cost is and the name of skill in a better way
OK player and enemy bullet should not pass walls.
- player fire should melt the ice instead of being vanished (and it's vanished because ice is a solid object).
OK when the player switch maps it must mantain the current element 
OK verify if scrolls do not respawn if already collected
OK retest interactions (I refactored it a bit)
OK re-check the scroll cost decrease and shard doors cost decrease when interacted with.
- Avoid that the c_slider or texts can cover the player or the interacting object.
OK test the shards moving towards the player (after the refactor of dist and moveTo)
OK test the boss movements.
OK Sometimes vines are not burnt when hit by fireball (see stage 4)
- bosses health must restore when player dies.
- improve design of health bar of bosses
- differentiate the 3 bosses with different attacks and patterns

-- TO AVOID THOSE TWO BUGS FOR NOW: act on the map design.
- map transition of player: sometimes it get stuck inside walls if some jumping is happening or there's strange combination of walls.
- dogs/walking creatures will not fall when out of platform.

OK add skeleton walking
OK add another flying enemy witch
OK add 1 or 2 more bosses

OK add a background parallax

- improve map design

- review the scroll descriptions
- music
- sound effects
- level design
