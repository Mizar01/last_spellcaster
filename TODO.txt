- change the name of the game and the project
OK create 4 types of elements: thunder, fire, ice, wind
OK create a switchlith that permits you to change element among those available

OK the fireball comes out wrong when shooting to the left
OK the hud position is messed up, again --> the problem is the order of updates, cam must be always first.
OK begin to shorten all the variable names. I hit the chars limit!
