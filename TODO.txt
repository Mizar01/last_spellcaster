Microvania
- change the name of the game and the project
OK create 4 types of elements: thunder, fire, ice, wind
OK create a switchlith that permits you to change element among those available
OK create a sliding text effect to show some messages on screen
- find a way to consume a button press after executing a function (to avoid multiple activations at the same frame)
OK the fireball comes out wrong when shooting to the left
OK the hud position is messed up, again --> the problem is the order of updates, cam must be always first.
OK begin to shorten all the variable names. I hit the chars limit!
- Bug: sometimes obj_solids are not removed when unfreeze (or maybe they are constantly re-added by some code?)
OK logging: log does not work before the config.lua call. find a way to load config first of everything
OK think about dropping the keys and doors system, is too heavy
- do another round of token/chars optimization, here usual suggestions:
   - put dstar strings in the first column of the file (no indent)
   - shorten some variable names
   - delete unused code
   - there's so much I don't use in c_obj.draw()

- when clicking on focus light, for a little moment a redline on top appears, investigate a remove it
OK performance issues when many enemies are on screen
  OK collisions with enemies must be done in the enemy update against c_element and player.
  OK split maps in smaller parts
OK doors do not have to interact with the player directly, but only through switches (remove interact inheritance)
OK implement the passage from a map to another when reaching the map border
OK refine the passage from a map to another vertically (now it it works only if the player doesnt move horizontally too much)
  OK the trick must be differnt from the horizontal one, because the player can jump and fall down
